# Credit-Card-fraud-detection
This script builds a fraud detection model using machine learning. It loads fraudTest.csv, preprocesses data (handles missing values, encodes categorical features, scales numerical data), splits it into training/testing sets, and trains a RandomForestClassifier. It then evaluates performance using accuracy and a classification report.
